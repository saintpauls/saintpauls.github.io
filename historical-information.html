&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the XIX century, many foreigners were attracted to the city port of Valparaíso, to put down roots, in what was the principal port in the navigation route by sea from and towards Europe, passing through Cape Horn. In that way, British and German nationals made their home in the Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepción hills of Valparaíso meeting in each other’s houses and school classrooms to worship and practice their religion. Eventually, they put enough money together to buy a property and therein build a church. This work was entrusted to English engineer William Lloyd Wright.

<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registries of the Church show us the names and professions of those who worshiped in that church throughout many years, including captains, merchants, masons, shipbuilders, musicians, piano builders, smiths, candle makers, artists, engineers, all which show us the ample welcoming embrace of Saint Paul´s Church.

<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic importance of Saint Paul´s Church as National Monument lies not only in its architectural transcendence but also as a link to understanding the integration process of British immigrants<!--s typoand their cultural legacy to our country.

The history of St Paul’s Cathedral</h1></center>
<div class="contain">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valparaiso was the most important port of call 
on the west coast of South America. Until the opening of the Panama 
Canal in 1914 all ships arrived via Cape Horn, taking at least two 
months from Liverpool, and sometimes up to six months with waiting for 
safe passage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many new arrivals in Valparaiso in the nineteenth century were of British and German origin, and the Anglicans and Lutherans and other Protestant Christians had no place in which to worship. St Paul’s was built in 1858. Note that the church has no spire, bell tower, external cross or main door because he government allowed the community to build St Paul’s on the condition that it kept a “low profile”. The church was built to be a “beacon on a hill” before there was religious freedom in Chile. It was named a national monument in 1979 and a cathedral in 2016, serving the Anglican community throughout Chile.

There are photographs inside which show what Valparaiso looked like at 
the time, with few other buildings and bare cliffs down to the sea.

The metal scrapers at the entrance to the cathedral were to remove mud 
from the shoes of people who arrived on foot, horseback or by carriage. 
As you enter the cathedral you will find the baptistry at the back, 
holding the limestone font.

Traditionally the font is at the entrance 
to a church building, to symbolise the fact that as Christians we enter 
the “church” when we are baptized. Above the font are stained glass 
windows in memory of the six children of Thomas Woodsend, who all died in infancy.

Above your heads the wooden curved beams are made of laminated Oregon 
pine, using a cutting edge technique, which was also used in the 
Crystal Palace and Charing Cross underground station, both of which 
have long since disappeared.

The ceiling has slanted 
boards, like the keel of a ship, which were used for added strength, 
and the whole construction was the work of the engineer William Lloyd, 
who came to Chile to work on railway bridges.

There have been many illustrious visitors over the years, including President Federico Errazuriz, the Prince of Wales in 1925, and Prince Philip in 1962. The pulpit was donated in memory of Isabel Lazonby in 1909, and it is used for the delivery of sermons, having good acoustics. The brass lectern holds the Bible for scripture readings.

The rood screen was installed in memory of Adolphus Walbaum, 1849-1923, 
who was one of the first parishioners and it separates the nave from 
the chancel, symbolizing the curtain in the Jewish synagogue, which was torn apart when Jesus died on the cross, allowing everyone to come closer to God. In medieval times rood screens would have prevented stray animals from entering the holy area.

The “Queen Victoria Memorial Organ” was designed by John Craig 
Christie and installed as a tribute to Queen Victoria with donations 
from members of the British community and the dates on either side 
(1837-1901) record the years of her reign. The organ was brought by 
ship round Cape Horn and collapsed three years after being installed in 
the earthquake of 1906, being later rebuilt in 1910. There is a free 
organ recital, “Música en las Alturas” with short prayers every 
Sunday from 12.30 to 13.00, with different organists taking part. For 
the programme please visit our <a href="https://www.saintpaulchile.cl">website</a>.

The communion table behind the railings is carved with the symbols of 
the alpha and omega, the wheat and the vine, and a central cross, and 
on the wall behind it are the Ten Commandments from Exodus 20, painted 
on either side of the main windows. The first four commandments speak 
of our relationship to Almighty God, whilst the last six speak of our 
relationship to each other.

The three panels of stained glass windows above the altar denote the 
life of St Paul, the patron saint of the cathedral, and the most widely 
travelled of Jesus’ followers. They were installed in 1883. The other 
windows around the cathedral illustrate biblical events and were 
installed in memory of loved ones, and some of them have been recently 
restored by a Chilean organization called <a 
href='http://www.espaciotransparente.cl'> "Espacio 
Transparente"</a>.<!-- Information about individual windows can be 
found on the website, and links can be followed from QR codes around 
the cathedral.-->
