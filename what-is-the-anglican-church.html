		<h3>A HISTORIC CHURCH</h3>
		
<!--
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-->
	
	School history books tend to say that the Anglican Church was invented by 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII </a>

	
	
	in order to legitimize his divorce. However, it does have to be said that that Henry VIII’s involvement in the life of the Anglican Church consisted of freeing it from Roman legislation. The Church was in a process of reform which would culminate in the third king after Henry.
	<br>
<!--
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-->
	Christianity has such a long history in Great Britain that some traditions claim that its founder was Joseph of Arimathea, and there are even others who suggest that Anglicanism came out of one of St Paul’s missionary journeys. Whatever the truth may be, the first historical fact that we can cite is the definite presence of three English bishops at the Council of Arles, in AD 313.

		<h3>A REFORMED CHURCH</h3>
		
<!--
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-->
	The rediscovery of the doctrine of 
	justification by faith by 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">Luther </a>
	

	
	set off a process of the reformation 
	of the antiquated medieval church, burdened with penances, 
	pilgrimages, fasts, absolutions, austerity, masses, relics, 
	indulgencies and many other activities which had the aim of gaining 
	salvation by human works.
	<br><br>
John Wycliff having already translated the Bible into English, the English Church  was a fertile field for receiving this rediscovery, which brought a joyful spiritual freedom which could not be contained by the medieval means. The law which negated the papal supremacy, and which was presented by the king to Parliament in 1534, started off the Reformation of the Church in England.

		<h3>A BIBLICAL CHURCH</h3>
		

The only advance made during the time of Henry VIII was the provision of Bibles in English for each church. The main reformatory impetus came under Edward VI’s reign, a period during which the Archbishop of Canterbury – 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>
 – wrote 
 

 “<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer
">The Book of Common Prayer</a>”,
 
 
  the origin and purpose of which was the search for, and establishment of, the biblical truth in the life of the church and of believers. This book, and its subsequent editions, have given Anglicanism its distinctive character.

		<h3>A COMPREHENSIVE CHURCH</h3>
		

The sufferings that came with the process of reform encouraged Queen 
Elizabeth I to infuse the church with a comprehensive and tolerant 
character, “<b>not enquiring too much into consciences</b>”. The 39 
Articles of Religion, approved in 1562, defined the limits of this 
comprehensive policy, with the Church being ready to subject its 
theology and practice to permanent revision in the light of the Holy 
Scriptures.<br><br>
The expansion of the Anglican Church throughout the world, penetrating into the most varied of cultures, has been possible thanks to this comprehensive spirituality which, trusting in the authority of the Holy Spirit, avoids forcing its members into absolute conformity.

		<h3>A CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT CHURCH</h3>
		


The Anglican Church considers itself to be a genuine part of the true church, the universal church, which at all times and in all places has confessed Jesus as Lord and Saviour, never forgetting that the ecclesiastical tradition is secondary to the apostolic tradition contained in the Scriptures. And it is precisely this point that explains its protestantism: not in opposition to the original catholicism but as its safeguard, since conserving the authoritarian value of the apostolic tradition is the very objective of the protestant Reformation.

		<h3>A SOUTH AMERICAN CHURCH</h3>

We will not go into details here of the great work of the Anglican Church in Brazil and others parts of the north of South America, but will limit ourselves to an overview of the part it has played in the Southern Cone, where, as well as establishing English chaplaincies in various cities, it started a sacrificial work amongst the natives of Patagonia, the Chaco and Araucania.
Captain Allen Gardiner arrived in Chile in 1838, with the aim of reaching the Mapuche  people. The difficulties forced him to change his objective, moving to Tierra del Fuego, the land of the yaganes. In 1851, he gave his life for Christ, dying of starvation in those distant lands. But the South American Missionary Society, which was founded in 1844 to sustain his missionary enterprise, would remain and produce fruit. Inspired by his commitment, many donations were given, both material and in the form of lives consecrated to the mission. The mission to the Chaco, led by Barbrooke Grubb (1890), and the mission to Araucania, led by Charles Sadlier (1894) have continued to this day, and their influence in the fields of education, health and development are a testimony to their dedication, along with the work of evangelization.
In 1958, at the Lambeth Conference, the bishops of the Anglican Commission recommended that the mission of evangelization be extended beyond the indigenous people, to all those who did not know Christ. In response to this challenge we see that Brazil and the Southern Cone of South America have developed to the point of becoming autonomous provinces, and the dioceses of Central America are also advancing rapidly, with the number of congregations growing and the ordination of national ministers.
